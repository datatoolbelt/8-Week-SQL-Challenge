## 3. Runner and Customer Experience

1. **How many runners signed up for each 1 week period?**
```sql
SELECT WEEK(registration_date) AS WEEK,
       COUNT(*) AS num_registrations
FROM runners
GROUP BY WEEK;
```
*Query Result:*
|week|num_registrations|
|--|--|
|0|1|
|1|2|
|2|1|
---

2.  **What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
```sql
WITH cte AS
  (SELECT o.order_id,
          ro.runner_id,
          o.order_time,
          ro.pickup_time,
          time_to_sec(timediff(ro.pickup_time, o.order_time))/60 AS pickup
   FROM customer_orders AS o
   INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
   GROUP BY o.order_id,
            ro.runner_id,
            o.order_time,
            ro.pickup_time)
SELECT runner_id,
       ROUND(AVG(pickup)) AS pickup_min
FROM cte
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
*Query Result:*
|runner_id|pickup_min|
|--|--|
|1|14|
|2|20|
|3|10|
---

3.  **Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**

- Yes, preparation time is directly proportional to the number of pizzas. 

```sql
WITH cte AS
  (SELECT o.order_id,
          COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizza,
          AVG(time_to_sec(timediff(ro.pickup_time, o.order_time))/60) AS pickup
   FROM customer_orders AS o
   INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
   GROUP BY o.order_id)
SELECT num_pizza,
       ROUND(AVG(pickup)) AS avg_prep_time_min
FROM cte
GROUP BY num_pizza;
```
*Query Result:*
|num_pizza|avg_prep_time_min|
|--|--|
|1|12|
|2|18|
|3|29|
---

4.  **What was the average distance travelled for each customer?**
```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       ROUND(AVG(ro.distance_km)) AS avg_distance_km
FROM customer_orders AS o
INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE cancellation = 'No'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
*Query Result:*
|customer_id|avg_distance_km|
|--|--|
|101|20|
|102|17|
|103|23|
|104|10|
|105|25|
---

5. **What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```sql
SELECT MAX(ro.duration_min)-MIN(ro.duration_min) AS delivery_time_range_min
FROM customer_orders AS o
INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation = 'No';
```
*Query Result:*
|delivery_time_range_min|
|--|
|30|

---

6.  **What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**

- Yes, there seems to be a trend here. As the runners gain experience of delivery their speed increases.

```sql
SELECT ro.runner_id,
       ro.order_id,
       o.order_time,
       ROUND(AVG(ro.distance_km/(ro.duration_min/60))) AS runner_speed_kmph
FROM customer_orders AS o
INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE ro.cancellation = 'No'
GROUP BY ro.runner_id,
         ro.order_id,
         o.order_time
ORDER BY o.order_id;
```
*Query Result:*
|runner_id|order_id|order_time|runner_speed_kmph|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|1|2020-01-01 18:05:02|38|
|1|2|2020-01-01 19:00:52|44|
|1|3|2020-01-02 23:51:23|40|
|2|4|2020-01-04 13:23:46|35|
|3|5|2020-01-08 21:00:29|40|
|2|7|2020-01-08 21:20:29|60|
|2|8|2020-01-09 23:54:33|94|
|1|10|2020-01-11 18:34:49|60|

---

7.  **What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
SELECT ro.runner_id,
       COUNT(*)*100/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS per_success
FROM customer_orders AS o
INNER JOIN runner_orders_clean AS ro ON o.order_id = ro.order_id
WHERE cancellation = 'No'
GROUP BY ro.runner_id;
```
*Query Result:*
|runner_id|per_success|
|--|--|
|1|50.00|
|2|41.67|
|3|8.33|
